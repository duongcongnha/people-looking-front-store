# Fast-API üöÄ

### Why This ? ü§®
    Need Clean and Scalable Code Architecture for ML/DL and NLP driven micro-service based Projects ?

    
###  **Introduction: Structuring of API**


- `api_template:`  Contains all the API related Code Base.
    - `manage.py:` Only entry point for API. Contains no logic. 
    - `.env:` Most important file for your api and contains global configs. Acoid using application/variable level configs here.
    - `application:`  It contains all your api related codes and test modules. I prefer keeping application folder at global.
    - `logs`: Logs is self-explanatory. FYI it will not contain any configuration information, just raw logs. Feel free to move according to your comfort but not inside the application folder.
    - `models:` As a part of Machine-Learning/ Deep-Learning app you might need to add model files here or if you have huge files on cloud add symlinks if possibles.
    - `resources:` To store any documentation, application related csv/txt/img files etc.
    - `settings:` Logger/DataBase/Model global settings files in yaml/json format.

- `application:` 
    - `main:` priority folder of all your application related code.
        - `üèó infrastructure:` Data Base and ML/DL models related backbone code
        - `üìÆ routers:` API routers and they strictly do not contain any business logic
        - `üì° services:` All processing and business logic for routers here at service layer
        - `‚öí utility:`
            - `config_loader` Load all application related config files from settings directory 
            - `logger` Logging module for application
            - `manager` A manager utility for Data Related Task which can be common for different services
        - `üêç config.py:` Main config of application, inherits all details from .env file
    - `test:` Write test cases for your application here.
    - `initializer.py:` Preload/Initialisation of Models and Module common across application. Preloading model improves inferencing.
    
### Running Locally ? üìç

    Run Command  **uvicorn manage:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000**

### Docker Support üê≥

    docker build -t fastapi-image  .
    docker run -d --name fastapi-container -p 8000:8000 fastapi-image

### Sample Demo App ~ Powered by Streamlit ‚ö°Ô∏è
![Screenshot 2021-05-16 at 6 56 19 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17409469/118399165-80045e00-b679-11eb-9416-8b73936e9b83.png)
    Always good to have an interface to show a quick demo üòÅ.
    `Note: manage.py runs the streamlit app as a subprocess. feel free to move it as per your need. `
